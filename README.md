Type (or Contents)

  Fortran files generating EXPEQ with ne, Te, and j.
  
  Input files (EXPEQ).
  
  Reading and plotting program for EQDSK.

Purpose

  Test of various Equilibium cases with different Press. and Current porfile of target plasma in the VEST.
  
  It is categoized into
  
    1. Pressure Profile, which is made by density profile and temperature profile, and
    
    2. Current Profile.

Description

  To predict and evaluate equilibium and stability of the target plasam for VEST, it is necessary to 
  
    1. find ST devices in the world and its status and
    
    1-1. select some devices which is similar to VEST || on the state of the VEST target, 
    
    2. find Tranport and bootstrap models and 
    
    2-1. choose appropriate transport model for VEST,
    
    3. conduct Equilibrium Computation with CHEASE
    
    3-1. estimate stability of plasma with DCON.
